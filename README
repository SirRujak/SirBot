INTRO

	Hello! This is a project to make a fully featured chatbot for twitch streams that is also open source. It is currently in very early alpha, but for basic tasks it might be able to do what you want already. Just as a warning, it may change greatly before it is done and we take no responsibility for any damage it may accidentally cause. Anyone and everyone can take the source and edit it as they please and do what they like with it as per the license, but for the moment I and one other person will be making official changes to it.

#########################################
REQUIREMENTS

	The NomBot currently uses the base Python 3.4 package. We are working to ensure that no extra dependancies are needed so only the base installation is needed. You can get the necessary version of python here:

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-340/

Also, it is required to create an OAuth password for your account. Go to the following link and click "Connect with Twitch" to obtain the OAuth password:

http://twitchapps.com/tmi/

Once you have that go to the NomBot/Source folder and rename the "sample_config" file to "config" and then replace the information inside. The OAuth portion needs only the number and letter combination found after "OAuth:" from the link.

Then either through the python shell or in a terminal/prompt navigate to the Source folder and type "python3 NomBot.py" without the quotes to start the bot.

HOW TO USE

	Within the source file open NomBot.py with any text editor(Python ships with its own editor if you are having troubles) and edit the three functions checkChatCommand, checkChatStandard, and checkChatWelcome with checks and responses for any command you want the bot to answer. The format for commands is as follows:

elif( chatData=="COMMAND_MESSAGE"):
	message = "MESSAGE_FOR_BOT_TO_SEND"

Timers have not been fully implemented yet so all information sent by the bot must be triggered by a command. Commands in the checkChatCommand function can be used by any moderator or the channel owner while checkChatStandard can be used by any viewer.
