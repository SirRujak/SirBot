# Intro
Hello! This is a project to make a fully featured chat bot for twitch streams while remaining open source for all to use. It is currently in a very early alpha, it currently functions as a client for their chat but not much else. It will be changing quickly so be on the look out for updates very soon! Anyone and everyone can do with this software as they wish, take a look at the license for specifics, but we want it to be truly open!


# REQUIREMENTS
The SirBot currently uses the base Python 3.4 package. We are working to ensure that no extra dependancies are needed so only the base installation is needed. You can get the necessary version of python here:

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-340/

Also, it is required to create an OAuth password for your account. Go to the following link and click "Connect with Twitch" to obtain the OAuth password:

http://twitchapps.com/tmi/

Once you have that go to the SirBot/Source folder and rename the "sample_config" file to "config" and then replace the information inside. The OAuth portion needs only the number and letter combination found after "OAuth:" from the link.

Then either through the python shell or in a terminal/prompt navigate to the Source folder and type "python3 SirBot.py" without the quotes to start the bot.


# HOW TO USE

SirBot is currently in a stage of change. It now has a user interface and the command system is undergoing a complete overhaul. When new information is available it will be posted! for now, you can launch SirBot.py in the Dev folder to see how it is working!
